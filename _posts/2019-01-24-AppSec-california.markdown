Forging a strong relationship with developers is essential part of creating an impactful AppSec program. Without it, your team will have little idea what's going on and will have trouble getting bugs fixed and features shipped. Segment has built strong ties to developers using our competition-based training featuring Burp Suite and OWASP Juice Shop, partnership during implementation of tooling, and contributions to the existing codebase. This presentation is chock full of practical examples and references that attendees can bring back to their organization.
