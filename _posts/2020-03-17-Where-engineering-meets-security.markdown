In this episode we're joined by Leif Dreizler, Senior Application Security Engineer at Segment. Although his specialization in AppSec started in security consulting during his senior year of college, his background has helped him embed security into engineering. Leif joined the podcast to discuss his journey into AppSec, his observations about the industry, and his recommendations for entering the field.
