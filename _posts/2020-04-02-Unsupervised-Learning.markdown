I join Unsupervised Learning's host, Daniel Miessler, to chat about how the Segment Security Org is structured and what the Security Engineering Team is focused on. We discussed our team's 'Security Metrics' project and our thought process around embedding within software engineering teams to build security centric services and features, like Authentication.
